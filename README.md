## Hello and welcome to my GitHub page.

I am currently pursing my passion and training to become a software engineer/developer as a member of the Pursuit Fellowship. Pursuit is a 12-month, Google-funded software engineering fellowship with a 9% acceptance rate whose graduates have been hired as developers at leading companies. 

My love for technology stems from analyzing my first PC as a teenager. My passion has since grown tremendously and led me to through several programs and careers including completing an IT Fundamentals Certification and Windows OS program at Job Corp. 

To further improve my skills, Iâ€™ve learned and studied basic C and basic systems administration, with some introductions to C#, and software design at several programs including General Assembly. After completing the pursuit Fellowship, I will on the road to becoming a video game developer.
